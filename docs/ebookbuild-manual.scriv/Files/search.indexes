            <Text>Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a information exchange standard that can be a used as an efficient alternative to eXtensible Markup Language (XML) by using JavaScript syntax rather than tags.
JSON is not part of the ePub standard, though it used by ebookbuild to store the e-book metadata and the page order in each project’s metadata.json file. I chose this format because it’s human-readable and an open standard that is natively supported by the Python programming language (among others).
In the current version of ebookbuild, the metadata.json file has to be modified manually. I plan on implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) frontend that makes retrieving and editing the e-book metadata even faster in the future.
Here is an example of a metadata.json file:



JSON Syntax

Objects
“An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with {left brace and ends with }right brace. Each name is followed by :colon and the name/value pairs are separated by ,comma.”
- Introducing JSON, JSON.org

Most of a JSON file consists of objects which are defined with a name and then a value.

Arrays
“An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [left bracket and ends with ]right bracket. Values are separated by ,comma.“
- Introducing JSON, JSON.org

Arrays are a collection of JSON objects with consistent attributes. I use an array to define the page order.


Comments
Comments are not supported by JSON, though I have created a series of JSON objects called “comment” such as “comment1”, “comment2”, “comment3”. Keep in mind these are live data and can be manipulated as such.

            <Text>Introduction to Regular Expression

“Regular expressions describe patterns that may either match or fail to match against strings. The simplest regular-expression tool is grep(1), a filter that passes through to its output every line in its input matching a specified regexp.”
—Eric S. Raymond, Art of Unix Programming

Regular expression (or simply regex) is a programming language designed to match text via patterns rather than an exact string. Regular expressions have been incorporated into the find &amp; replace function of many text editors including Visual Studio Code, Atom and Notepad++.
Most of the syntax uses symbols called wildcards to represent characters within a text file such as: spaces, tabs, words and end of lines.
Try not to be put off by the intimidating syntax of regex because learning it is one of the best ways to save time and be efficient in e-book production. When I worked in commercial e-book development my colleague and I would frequently pass around a printout of Dave Child’s Regex cheatsheet (archive) as a handy reference.
I recommend trying these examples yourself. You can modify an XHTML file or instead use RegEx Pal to test each regular expression safely away from your production code.
Keep in mind that the regular expression syntax can vary between software or programming language. Both Atom and Visual Studio Code use JavaScript regex rules, but Notepad++ uses Perl-Compatible Regex Engine (PCRE) rules instead.

Tabs

Let’s start by adding two tabs to indent our indented paragraphs that use the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags.    Type this in the find textbox within the Find function:

^&lt;p&gt;

This is a very simple piece of regex that only uses the caret (^) wildcard which represents the beginning of a line. This regex assumes there is no spacing or tabs prior to the start of the &lt;p&gt; tag.
Now for the regex to add the two tabs:

\t\t&lt;p&gt;

The \t wildcard represents a tab, so I’ve added two of them. Doing this indents your XHTML code nicely making it much easier to read. Try and imitate the indentation and spacing of the XHTML code that the content has in the web browser to make debugging a lot easier.
You can recreate this example on RegEx Pal by typing this in the Test String box:

&lt;p&gt;

Newlines




Spaces

\s

Dot-plus-question mark
The dot-plus-question (.+?) mark is a sequence of wildcards that can be defined as ‘anything’. More specifically, this sequence utilises the following:

The dot (.) matches any single character except end of line characers such as 
 or 
The plus (+) marches one

Registers
Registers are used to save text that doesn’t need to be changed. Use standard parentheses () in the find and then recall the saved text with the dollar sign ($) (or backslash (\) in Notepad++)
In the context of e-book production this tends to be content between tags to alter the opening and closing tags.

&lt;strong&gt;(.+?)&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;$1&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;em&gt;(.+?)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;i&gt;$1&lt;/i&gt;

Alternatively, I could have simply changed each tag at a time. Whoever, by using registers I can implement the modern bold and italic tags (as described in my Introduction to XHTML chapter) with just 2 pairs of regex statements.
I did this for each chapter of the e-book adaptation of the open-source Survival Manual by Ligi , due to my use of the pandoc documentation conversion software to convert the files from Markdown which is used on GitHub’s wiki pages to XHTML.
Another example of a suitable use for regex registers would be changing the heading tag numbering, such as from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h2&gt;.

Wildcard character escaping
Sometimes your desired pattern contains a reserved symbol that regex syntax uses. Refer to the table below with reserved regex wildcard characters: 

//Regex reservation table

In these situations a backslash (\) is required before the symbol itself. For example, if I want to match all text included in a pair of paratheses I would use the following:

\(.+?\)

A backlash can also be used recursively to escape the backslash itself:

\\

            <Text>Advanced Typography

OpenType is popular font format and replacement for TrueType. Some of these features require software that has complete support for OpenType such as Microsoft Word and Affinity Designer.
Adobe licences fonts with the “Pro” suffix that support OpenType extensively, several of which are installed with the Adobe Creative Cloud such as Minion Pro and Myriad Pro.

Ligatures

Ligatures are two or more conjoined glyphs used for aesthetic purposes, which usually (though not always) provide improved readability. As with any typographical feature, it’s support may vary between each e-reader and should not be guaranteed.

#
The letters “fi”, “ff” and “fl” are commonly presented as a ligature

Some characters such as the ampersand (&amp;) were previously ligatures that became an individual glyph over time.

Old Roman cursive, reed pen, 131 AD.
New Roman cursive, middle of 4th century.
New Roman cursive, ca 346 AD.
From a manuscript (St. Hilarius), before 509.
From a manuscript (St. Maximus), 7th century.
Carolingian minuscule, 810.
#
The evolution of the ampersand from the word “et” to an individual glyph.

In software development there are several monospaced fonts that support ligature symbols such as Cascadia Code, Fira Code (a modification of Fira Mono) and JetBrains Mono. Most programming languages rely on certain sequences of symbols as part of the syntax such as “!=”, “==” and “++”.

//Symbol ligature example diagram

Text figures

Text figures (also called old-style figures) are numerals with alternating dimensions for readability within paragraphs. They are mostly historic and prevalent in antiquarian books, though some fonts such as Georgia support them by default or as stylistic alternates.
Usually text figures are drawn with the following pattern:

The 0, 1 and 2 share the x-height with the rest of the lowercase letters. 
3 goes below the baseline.
4 goes above the x-height.
5 goes below the baseline.
6 goes above the x-height.
7 goes below the baseline.
8 goes above the x-height.
9 goes below the baseline.

#
Example of the text figures from the Hoefler Text typeface

Lining figures

Tabular figures

Tabular figures are numerals that consume the same width (just like with monospaced fonts) and are recommended for typesetting documents such as financial reports.

Stylistic alternates

Stylistic alternates are alternative glyphs that can be optionally substituted with the original glyph. Usually stylistic alternates allow a designer to decide if they want a typeface’s single-storey or double-storey letters such as “a” and “g”.

The popular font Inter includes many different stylistic alternates

            <Title>Manual of Style</Title>
            <Text>Manual of Style

The Chicago Manual of Style is a popular reference book for formal writing that is used worldwide. Taking inspiration from this I want to define best practices for writing that aren’t necessarily confined to just e-book development.

Paragraphs:

Scene break:

A scene break separates paragraphs without the use of a heading and is common in novelwriting, where it behaves similarly to a scene transition effect in film-making.
Usually a dinkus (see asterisk in Manual of Style) which is a line of three asterisks (* * *) is used for a scene break.
Alternatively use a fleuron or another piece of decorative typography that clearly shows the reader where the scene break is. For example, the author Violet E.C makes use of a decorative fleuron from Adobe Garamond:

#

Adobe Garamond has this decorative fleuron that can be used for scene breaks

Another example of a non-dinkus scene break was used on the PowerPoint presentation for theChristmas carol services back at my secondary school. This break would show the end of a Christmas carol and is comprised of a hyphen (-), lowercase (o), number zero (0), lowercase (o) and another hyphen (-).
#
Back at my secondary school this symbol was used to show the end of a Christmas carol.

Text formatting:

Italic:
Italic is used as alternative to bold for emphasis to make a particular word or phrase more prominent to a reader. It is also common to italicise the names of works such as books, films, music and video games. For example I italicised the Chicago Manual of Style in this chapter’s introductory paragraph.

Superscript:
Superscripting makes the font smaller and places it above the cap height. 
Superscript is used for numerical ordinals such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th. As well as citational references inside paragraphs, as you’ll have noticed throughout this book.
Some large brands such Amazon and Microsoft superscript currency subunits (along with or without the decimal point) at medium to large font sizes. Such as: £1199

Subscript:
Subscripting makes the font smaller and places it below the baseline. 
It is commonly used for chemical formulae such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or sulphuric acid (H2SO4).

Small caps:
Small caps (Small Caps) are capital letters that are the same height as the lowercase letters (i.e. the font’s x-height).
They are commonly used stylistically for the names of people as a form of emphasis. For example, in some Christian Bible translations the word “Lord” is written in small caps such as in this Bible passage taken from Bible Gateway:

“12 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:” —Genesis 12:1, King James Version (KJV)

Unfortunately, some e-reading software such as Adobe Digital Editions does not support small caps and ignores them. I don’t recommend relying on small caps compatibility for digital documents unless a supported font has been embedded.
True small caps are an an Opentype feature of a font are different to the x-height adjusted capital letters that programs such as Microsoft Word utilise. Matthew Broderick, author of Typography for Lawyers refers to these pseudo-small caps as “inferior counterfeits” and strongly advises against using them.
https://typographyforlawyers.com/small-caps.html (archive: https://archive.ph/XUfty)

Hyperlinks:
Hyperlinks are used to connect text, images or other content to an external resource. In most webpages and documents, hyperlinks appear underlined blue for unvisited and then turn purple once clicked.

For web hyperlinks, I try to use HyperText Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to force security on the web browser such as Brave, Chrome or Firefox.
I also add an archive link in parentheses from archive.today (or one of its aliases such as archive.is or archive.me), or alternatively from archive.org’s Wayback Machine to prevent link rot. I have an explanation of link rot in my example below:

Link rot (Wikipedia article, archive) is a situation when a hyperlink no longer brings a person to the correct webpage on the internet. This is a concern for any kind of project that relies on websites for researching information, therefore I recommend making use of archive websites (such as archive.today or the Wayback Machine) to preserve references. One alternative to archive websites is to save each required webpage as a PDF file.

For e-mail addresses there is a “mailto:” prefix instead of the usual “http” or “https”. From there a web browser and certain e-reader software (not Google Play Books) can open the user’s e-mail client or at least ask the user what to do with e-mail address links.

In print media I keep the hyperlink underlined and in black for greyscale printing (retain the blue for colour) with the linked pathname written out as concisely as possible. 
For example, hyperlinks to a product page on Amazon can be written concisely with “dp” (I assume this means “display product”) then the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN): https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00QMW6LQC

Redaction
Redaction is obfuscation of text for confidentiality purposes.
Usually redaction is performed via two techniques:

Pixelation is where the redacted content has been distorted usually into pixels. Pixelation has be proven to be algorithmically reversible via tools. Dan Petro, a researcher at cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox created the Unredactor tool which can convert a formerly pixelated image and reveal the redacted text in cleartext. There are also algorithms that can remove pixelation and blur fro
https://bishopfox.com/blog/unredacter-tool-never-pixelation (archive: https://archive.ph/I2GHz)

Box drawing is where a coloured box covers the redacted content. F-Secure demonstrated it is possible to reverse box drawing, but only when it’s improperly drawn using a PDF editor such as Nitro. They recommend printing and then scanning the document once the redactions have been applied by hand, perhaps using a permanent marker. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nujqq8GXIA4


Symbols:

Hyphens, en dashes and em dashes
When I started my first job I used a hyphen every time I wanted a dash. There are actually 3 types of dash and they each have a specific purpose:

Hyphen (-)
A hyphen is used to join (or concatenate) words together. For example: 
	e-mail, e-book

En dash (–)
An en dash gets its name because is the same width as a lowercase “n”. En dashes are used to join statements or to provide a numerical range. Using the English civil war Wikipedia page as an example, notice how the dates are connected with an en dash:

“The English Civil War (1642–1651) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians (&quot;Roundheads&quot;) and Royalists (&quot;Cavaliers&quot;),”

Em dash (—)
An em dash is the same width as a lowercase “m”. Em dashes are used for quote attribution, such as:

“I am not young enough to know everything.” —J.M. Barrie

Speech marks:
Double speech marks (“, ”, &quot;)
Double speech marks (or quote marks) are used for speech in most European languages and can be used for defining attributes in XHTML. There are three double quote marks, a left quote (“), right quote (”) and a straight quote (&quot;). I prefer to use the curled left and right quote marks as they look more presentable. Some books such as How I Live Now by Meg Rossoff forgo speech marks entirely.
There are languages such as German, Hungarian and Polish that use different quote marks with the left pair sitting on the baseline. 

Single speech marks (‘, ‘, ‘)
Double speech marks (or quote marks) are also used for speech in most European languages and can also be used for defining attributes in XHTML. There are three double quote marks, a left quote (‘), right quote (‘) and a straight quote (‘). 

Guillemets («, »)
Guillemets are used for speech by some languages such as French, Italian and Greek. They are functionally identical to double speech marks.

Single guillemets (‹, ›)
 Single guillemets are reportedly used for nested quotes (quotes within quotes) though I haven’t used them.

Paragraph symbols:
//Alphabetise

Degree (°)
The degree (°) symbol is used for mathematical purposes.
The degree symbol is commonly used to denote units of temperature, particularly on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scales.
While there are combined ℃ and ℉ symbols in Unicode, these are discouraged by the Unicode Consortium due to being legacy characters. It’s recommended to use the degree symbol followed by the unit of temperature.

Unicode symbols:

U+00B0 ° DEGREE SIGN 
U+2103 ℃ DEGREE CELSIUS (deprecated)
U+2109 ℉ DEGREE FAHRENHEIT  (deprecated)


Pilcrow (¶)
The pilcrow (¶) is a mostly obsolete symbol used for defining the start of paragraphs. Pilcrows can be enabled in word processors such as Microsoft Word to assist with document layout.
A pilcrow is commonly used for stylistic purposes. For example, in the 1931 book An Essay on Typography by Eric Gill starts each paragraph is set with a pilcrow:

“¶ The theme of this book is Typography, and Typography as it is affected by the conditions of the year 1931. The conflict between industrialism &amp; the ancient methods of handicraftsmen which resulted in the muddle of the 19th century is now coming to its term.”

Some typefaces such as Doves Type and Lyon Display have distinctive pilcrow symbols. The standard pilcrow has a distinct “P” shape, though some type designers prefer the “C” shape from the pilcrow’s predecessor, the capitulum symbol.
I recommend using only use the standard pilcrow symbol unless the font supports it and the font is unlikely to change.

Unicode symbols:

U+00B6 ¶ PILCROW SIGN
U+204B ⁋ REVERSED PILCROW SIGN
U+2761 ❡ CURVED STEM PARAGRAPH SIGN ORNAMENT
U+2E3F ⸿ CAPITULUM



HTML entities:

¶ - &amp;para; or &amp;#182;

//diagram

Section (§)
The section symbol is used to mark individual numbered sections of a large document and is commonly used in the law profession. For example, section 1201 of Title 17 expressly forbids the circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) systems:

“17 U.S. Code § 1201 - Circumvention of copyright protection systems”

It is also a less commonly used non-numerical citational referencing symbol and the Simoleon currency symbol in the video game series SimCity and The Sims.

Asterisk (*)
The asterisk (*) means “little star” in Greek and is commonly used as the first reference in a chapter that uses non-numerical citational referencing, especially in print advertising such as billboards, posters and magazines.
The asterisk is also used on online forms to denote mandatory fields that are required for submission. Usually these asterisks are red to increase their visibility.
Asterisks can also be used as a dinkus (often referred to as a section break or scene break) to separate paragraphs. Usually there are three asterisks in a series between the paragraphs. Alternatively, an asterism symbol can be used which places three asterisks in a triangular formulation though this is considered outdated.

Unicode symbols:

U+002A * ASTERISK

HTML entities:

* - &amp;#42; or &amp;ast; or &amp;midast;

Dagger (†)
The dagger (†) is commonly used for marking deceased people or extinct species to the left or right of their name. It is also used as the second reference in a chapter that uses non-numerical citational referencing.

Double dagger (‡)
The double dagger (‡) is commonly used for the third reference in a chapter that uses non-numerical citational referencing.

Triple dagger
There is a triple dagger symbol, though it has not been approved by Unicode and few fonts support it. If it does get ratified by the Unicode Consortium it could be used as a potential fourth symbol in non-numerical citational referencing.

At symbol (@)
The at symbol (@) is mostly used for separating the mailbox name from the domain name in e-mail addresses. Some brands use…

Hash symbol (#)
The hash symbol (#) (also called the pound sign) is commonly used for hashtags. As well as for deno…
In e-book development, the hash symbol used for declaring numerical entities in XHTML by following the ampersand (&amp;). For example the entity &amp;#160; is for a non-breaking space. The hash symbol is also used in CSS to declare a hexadecimal colour. For example, the colour red is #FF0000. 
The hash symbol is used for adding comments in Python which are ignored by the interpreter when the program is run.

Ampersand (&amp;)
The ampersand (&amp;) is commonly used to…

Ellipsis (…)
The ellipsis (…) is a series of three dots without a space and usually used to denote a quote or phrase which has more content.

Primes (′) and double primes (″)
Primes and double primes are respectively used for abbreviating feet and inches, though they have apparent other uses in typesetting scientific, linguistic and musical works.
Some typefaces, notably Adobe Garamond don’t have prime symbols. An acceptable substitute for primes in this case are quote marks, preferably straight quote marks.


#
In Literata 12pt, the measurement 5 feet, 3 inches can be abbreviated in four different ways:
1. Primes 2. Curly quotes 3. Straight quotes 4. Oblique straight quotes with a 15° right-tilt

Basic mathematical symbols:
These are the simple mathematical symbols for arithmetic usage which most fonts are likely to support.

Multiplication (×)
The multiplication symbol is used for multiplying values together. It’s also the correct way to write out screen resolutions. For example:

“A high definition monitor supports the 1920 × 1080 resolution.”

Divide ()

Minus ()

Plus (+)

Tilde (~)
The tilde is used for approximation. It is also used as a diacritic in some languages such as Spanish and Portuguese.

Brackets

Square brackets ([, ])
Square brackets are used to provide commentary when quoting an original source. For example, adding an extra word within a quote to provide better clarity, such as with this quote. I have left my contribution unitalicised to further state it’s not part of the original quote:

“The greatest hypnotist on planet Earth is an oblong box [television] in the corner of the room. It is constantly telling people what to believe is real!” —David Icke

Another use of square brackets in this way is to quote a misspelling, incorrect grammar or nonsensical content verbatim using [sic].


Referencing:
In formal writing there are two types of referencing, citational and parenthetical.

Citational references uses either a number or symbol at the end of a sentence, or in some cases at the end of a word. Usually this citation number is superscripted, though Wikipedia uses square brackets instead.

Parenthetical referencing uses… It’s best known as Harvard referencing as it was popularised by a Harvard University zoological paper… 

Miscellaneous:

Fiat currencies:
For fiat currencies, I use the ISO 4217 currency code in front of the currency symbol. ISO 4217 ties the currency name to the country code to remove ambiguity and is recommended for currency names that are shared across many countries such as the dollar, pound, crown, lira, won and rupee.
Here is a concise table of the most common currencies and their respective ISO 4217 code:

USD, EUR, GBP, INR, KOW, JPY, RUB, CZK


Some countries have unique currency names with accompanying symbols such as the Euro (€), Israeli new shekel (₪), Japanese yen (¥), Russian ruble (₽) and Thai Baht (฿).
Support for certain currency symbols is not guaranteed among fonts, in those situations just use the ISO 4217 code on its own.
There is a generic currency symbol (¤) which can be used for unspecified currencies.
Some currencies also don’t have an official currency symbol.

Cryptocurrencies:
I refer to cryptocurrencies in full and with their suggested currency symbol (and pseudo-ISO 4217 code if applicable). Bitcoin (₿) is the only cryptocurrency with a recognised currency symbol within Unicode which supersedes the Thai Baht symbol unless the chosen font doesn’t support it.

Checksums:
Checksums are used for verifying file integrity (though not folders) to ensure it has not been altered in transmission.

The Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm has been proven to be vulnerable to malicious alternation and shouldn’t be trusted. The 2013 research paper Fast Collision Attack on MD5 by Tao Xie, Fanbao Liu and Dengguo Feng demonstrates it has been progressively easier to exploit MD5. I may remove MD5 support from ebookbuild in the future.

Abstract

This essay is my attempt to define copyright then pragmatically understand the motivations of piracy, argue against the use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and refute common stereotypes that are ingrained into the topic. My goal is to create discussion, not outrage then provide practical solutions to publishers and consumers alike.

Introduction

Piracy has been a topic of fascination for me since I was a teenager and discovered BitTorrent around 2009. Since then, I have gathered many different perspectives over the years from discussions I've had and from watching videos, reading articles... Admittedly much of my research is near to a decade old and I will try and provide contemporary perspectives...

What is copyright?

Copyright is a type of intellectual property law designed to protect a created work (such as a book, painting, video game, musical recording, etc…) under a limited term (which varies by country) by only allowing a designated right’s holder to create copies of said work.
	Current copyright law for most (if not all) jurisdictions means all works are automatically copyrighted unless explicitly released into the public domain.

Fair Use
%A justification for certain uses of unauthorised copyrighted content

“Fair use is a copyright principle based on the belief that the public is entitled to freely use portions of copyrighted materials for purposes of commentary and criticism. For example, if you wish to criticize a novelist, you should have the freedom to quote a portion of the novelist’s work without asking permission. Absent this freedom, copyright owners could stifle any negative comments about their work.”
Fair Use as defined by Stanford University
https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/ https://archive.ph/k2Ac2

Many jurisdictions offer limited protections for derivatives created from copyrighted content such as the United States’ Fair Use doctrine which can be used to justify commentary and criticism of a work. The concern is that without Fair Use a copyright holder could theoretically claim all criticism of a work to be copyright infringement. The UK equivalent is called Fair Dealing and has a similar structure.
	The popular video hosting website YouTube has had a lot of controversy regarding its filing and resolution of copyright infringement claims under the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and its handling of Fair Use. The social media hashtag #WheresTheFairUse originating from NostalgiaCritic’s Doug Walker is a popular example of this movement.

One example of abuse of the Fair Use doctrine is Derek Savage, the creator of mascot character CoolCat and his line of books and movies. The movie CoolCat Saves the Kids was reviewed by YouTube critic YourMovieSucks and this video was taken down by Savage for copyright infringement using a DMCA takedown request. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5ZmVheuxpo
	Savage did explain himself in a video as to why he filed the notice. One point raised in this video was a common misconception is that creators intended to create a derivative work from another copyrighted work require permission from the original copyright holder. This is untrue, though could be recommended to foster good faith between the two parties and is likely why Weird Al Yankovic sought permission from the creators of songs he would later parody.
	Then using a list article from 99Designs, he would use examples where derivative works were not found to be Fair Use and in-fact are examples of copyright infringement. A memorable example is a drawing of a bench that was then made into a statue, by another creator.

//Still more to write regarding Fair Use controversies

Public domain

The public domain are works that have no copyright holder and therefore no copyright protection, the vast majority of these are because the copyright term has expired though some works are put explicitly into the public domain.
	Some works are ineligible for copyright but are protected by different intelluctal property laws such as trademarks and patents.
	The public domain is usually associated with famous literary works as such as the Shakespearean plays, Pride and Prejuicide by Jane Austen and Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.
	Each 1st January is Public Domain Day and I recommend that every reader takes a look at what has released. My favourite public domain contribution in 2022 is the entire original Rider-Waite tarot card artwork, keep in mind that redrawings such as the Radiant Rider-Waite tarot deck are still copyright protected.

What is piracy?

Piracy is a colloquialism for copyright infringement which can be further defined as the unauthorised use or copying of a particular work without the approval of the copyright holder and without justification provided by complimentary laws such as the aforementioned Fair Use. Remember all works that are not explicitly within the public domain.

Piracy is not theft
Copyright ≠ Theft

Despite efforts by large publishing companies such as book publishers, record labels and movie studios, piracy is not theft by legal definition nor can it be defined as theft directly in practice. 
	At best piracy being equal to theft is a simplified metaphor to make copyright infringement more understandable to consumers of copyrighted content.
	Large publishers have spent millions of dollars collectively in advertising designed to re-enforce this flawed message. A popular example is the famous You Wouldn’t Steal a Car advert that was included on many DVD releases of films throughout the 2000s.

//Image

The You Wouldn’t Steal a Car advert is worth examining, particularly as it became an internet meme with several parodies highlighting its absurdity. My favourite parody was used on the British sitcom The IT Crowd.

An earlier example of piracy being equal to theft is the cassette and crossbones logo promoted by British Phonographic Industry (BPI) with the tagline “HOME TAPING IS KILLING MUSIC AND IT’S ILLEGAL”. 
	This logo would later be re-purposed by the Swedish BitTorrent website The Pirate Bay as part of their logo. Perhaps as retribution, the BPI would later successfully apply for the domain http://piratebay.se to be banned in the UK though this would be later proven to be ineffective due to the prevalence of proxy websites.

#
The cassette and crossbones logo

Now I’ve explained the propaganda, it’s time to debunk it and explain why piracy is not equal to theft.
	Let’s take the example that a popular movie was released and has 10,000 pirated downloads from several BitTorrent websites. Now this studio has found out from the publicly viewable download statistics that 6,000 people have downloaded this film illegally and claimed each download is an act of theft.
	The problem is they can’t prove it’s theft with a simple question: How many people downloaded that film out of curiosity with no intention of purchasing a cinema ticket?
	Infact, they may have later liked the film so much they would purchase a copy once it was available on home media such as a DVD. Or instead they disliked the film and wouldn’t interact with it any further.
	The example of piracy being equal to theft is referred to as the lost sale fallacy because a publisher cannot prove which proportion of pirated downloads lead to a “lost sale”. I pay attention to claimed lost sales because they are commonly used by large publishers to justify anti-piracy measures such as digital rights management (DRM).
	While the example I created is contrived, there is repeated data to suggest that pirates purchase more content than the average consumer and large publishers still can’t define lost sales. https://www.vice.com/en/article/evkmz7/study-again-shows-pirates-tend-to-be-the-biggest-buyers-of-legal-content https://archive.ph/vfuyO

Piracy is a service problem

Piracy being a service problem is the most prevalent and justifiable discussion of piracy. Abandonware refers to video games and software that are no longer maintained by an official development team.

In the video The Legality And Ethics Of Emulation | Feedback Loop, the Canadian YouTube creator Tarmack discusses the legality of emulator projects such as Cemu and Citra, which emulate the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS respectively.
…
One aspect of Tarmack’s video that I couldn't pass commenting on was using the original 1993 Doom game as an example of abandonware. This couldn’t be further from the truth because the source code for Doom’s game engine was released under GNU GPLv2 (General Public License) allowing player modification providing public releases of these modifications have available source code, prospective players still need a copy of the doom.wad file which cannot be freely distributed to play the full game. Releasing the game engine under GPLv2 has allowed ongoing development for a video game that is almost 30 years old by the fan community albeit under separate projects with different goals.
YouTube creator Modern Vintage Gamer is himself a game developer who has unofficially ported Doom to the original Xbox console and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and has one of the best explanations as to why Doom is ported to just about any electronic device that supports the C++ programming language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVnGCeB_2QI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU4-7jltj0o

Nintendo is perhaps the single most controversial company on the topic of abandonware. 
	From 2019, Nintendo demonstrated a concerning pattern of behaviour that each online store would have around 10-12 years of use before being shutdown and subsequently made unavailable forever. 
	This started with the Nintendo Wii’s Shop Channel with an estimated 1,000 digital-only games removed with no way to re-download them officially after a grace period. Followed by the DSi and now the 3DS and Wii U stores have been announced for closure in March 2023.
Following these trends, I would anticipate the Nintendo Switch eShop will be closed in the year 2027 or 2028.
	Nintendo is something of an outlier when compared to competing video game consoles from their respective eras such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

            <Text>Introduction to XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) 

“XML is a very simple syntax resembling HTML — angle-bracketed tags and ampersand-led literal
sequences. It is about as simple as a plain-text markup can be and yet express recursively nested
data structures. XML is just a low-level syntax; it requires a document type definition (such as
XHTML) and associated application logic to give it semantics.” 
—Eric S. Raymond, Art of Unix Programming

HTML (HyperText Markup Lanaguage) is a markup language that is used to define the content on webpages. This technology is the backbone of e-books because it allows book content to be defined and placed.

XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is the recommended language for creating the actual chapters of an e-book, it combines regular HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that is used to create webpages with XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Alternatively, you can use regular HTML though you can’t define custom tags (or can you?) and web browsers are more tolerant of obvious syntax errors when testing.

So what is XHTML? To start with I have used Eric S. Raymond’s definition of XML as a springboard. All three standards are markup languages this means that the developer has to define what the file’s content will look like using some kind of text syntax (if you understand LaTeX or Markdown this should be familiar), which in this case are tags.

Elements and Tags
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

Tags are made using a less-than symbol (&lt;) followed by the name of an element which is one word, abbreviation or letter, then by a greater-than symbol (&gt;), the text content itself is then written inside the tag and then closed with a closing tag that is identical though with a forward slash (/) after the less-than symbol. 
Some tags are “self-closing” which means that they are defined in just one tag with a less-than symbol, tag name, then the forward slash and the greater-than symbol. Each tag represents specific types of content such as headings, paragraphs, images, tables, or numbered and bullet point lists.

Attributes
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes

Attributes are parameters used by tags and are declared within a tag using the attribute name, equals sign (=) and single quotes (‘ ‘) or double quotes (“ “). 
Some attributes such as “id” and “class” are applicable to most tags. Other tags have attributes that required for the tag to function such as “href” used in anchor tags and “src” used in image tags.

I would recommend taking a look at one of the .xhtml files of this e-book while I explain the concepts. 

There are 3 parts to an XHTML file:

Declaration – defines to the web browser or e-reader what the file is, what standard of HTML/XML and what character encoding it uses.
Head – defines to the web browser or e-reader, the files and metadata the XHTML file uses.
Body – defines the actual content that the user will see in their web browser or e-reader.

Declaration
We start the file with a declaration to let the e-reader or web browser know this is an XHTML file. I usually copy-paste this and leave it alone.

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot; ?&gt;&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;

I always use UTF-8 as it has a large language support including accented Latin characters, Greek and Cyrillic (the writing system used in Russia, Ukraine and several Baltic states).

Head
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head

The head defines information about the XHTML file that the user doesn’t see. Similarly to the declaration, I barely change this except for the optional title tag so I can see the chapter’s name in my web browser during testing.

&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta content=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml; charset=utf-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;link href=&quot;styles/zstylesheet.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

The head tag is where the XHTML’s page name can be optionally declared for using in a web browser with the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; tags. 

The meta tag &lt;meta/&gt; defines metadata that the web browser or e-reader can use as a reference.

The link tag &lt;link&gt;&lt;/link&gt; declares external CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) files (that use the .css file extension), for more information on this refer to the Introduction to Cascading StyleSheets (CSS) chapter.

Body
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body

The body is all the content that the user will see (with the exception of comments) and is the majority of the XHTML file. Each piece of content is separated into tags depending on what the content is and where it should go on the page. XHTML is interpreted linearly by the web browser and e-reader starting from top to bottom.

Some tags can be used on their own, though most require text content between the tags and specific attributes and classes in order to work correctly.

Headings
There are six separate tags for declaring headings in XHTML and regular HTML, which go as follows: &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; and &lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;. 

I haven’t used all six heading tags in a project because CSS allows me to define what size each heading should be, as well as whether it uses emphasis (bold, italic or none) and want font type (sans-serif or serif).

Paragraphs
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p

Paragraphs and other areas of the book that solely display body text are declared with the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags. 
Most of an e-book’s content will use paragraph tags, unless the book is image-heavy such as graphic novel. 

I also use paragraph tags to force images to be centred.

Bold
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b

Bold is declared within content using the &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Historically, bold was declared with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tags and they should also theoretically work in modern e-readers.

Italic
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i

Italic is declared with content using the &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Historically, bold was declared with &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tags and they should also theoretically work in modern e-readers.

Span
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span

Span tags are used to apply CSS formatting to specified content within other tags. Some formatting such as text colour, underlining and strikethroughs have no specific tag and require span tags to be used. For example, I have this sentence:

This text is red and underlined.

The simplest way to put this sentence into XHTML is with the following:

&lt;p&gt;This text is &lt;span class=”red-word”&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; and underlined.&lt;/p&gt;

The CSS class for red-word is as follows:

.red-word {
  color: #f00;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-underline: underline;
}

Hyperlinks
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a

Hyperlinks are declared with the anchor tags &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The anchor tags require the “href” attribute to define an internal or external hyperlink.

Internal links can refer to a particular XHTML file within the ePub just like an image source declaration:

//

Alternatively an internal hyperlink can refer to a specific position within the current XHTML file using the hash (#) symbol.

//

External links can be declared using HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) or regular HTTP (which isn’t secure). 

//

E-mail addresses can be hyperlinked using “mailto:”, though some e-readers such as Google Play Books don’t support them:

&lt;p&gt;E-mail: &lt;a href=”mailto:hal@example.com”&gt;hal@example.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

hal@example.com

Superscripting and subscripting
Superscript and subscript have their own tags which are &lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. For example:

&lt;p&gt;Payday is the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Payday is the 1st of each month.

The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.

Images
Mozilla documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img

All images are declared with the self-closing &lt;img/&gt; tag. The &lt;img/&gt; tag requires several attributes to work which are “src” and “alt”. For example, I want to embed a photograph of a flower into a XHTML page:

&lt;img src=”images/flower.jpg” alt=””/&gt;

The “src” attribute is the source, it takes a filepath to the image that is to be displayed starting from the location of the .xhtml file. In this example the flower image is in an appropriately named “images” folder.

The “alt” attribute is used to define alternative text in the even the image doesn’t load and is mandatory within the ePub standard even if it’s left empty (not sure why as the image should be part of the ePub file).

There are additional attributes such as “width” and “height” which define dimensions, though I prefer to crop down to the desired dimensions to ensure my ePub’s file size isn’t excessively large.

Bullet point lists
Mozilla references:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li

Bullet point lists are referred to as “unordered lists” and use the &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; tags, followed by &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; for each bullet point. Using CSS it is possible to specify which type of bullet should precede each list entry.

For example, take this list of ingredients for a Victoria sponge cake:

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
	 &lt;li&gt;Castor sugar&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Which creates the following list:

Unsalted butter
Castor sugar
Flour

Numbered lists
Mozilla reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol

Numbered lists are referred to as “ordered lists” and use the &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; tags, as well as &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; for each bullet point. Using CSS it is possible to specify which type of numbering (such as the Latin alphabet or Roman numerals) should be used for each entry. 

For example, take this list of ingredients for a Victoria sponge cake:

The &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; tag has an addition attribute called “start” which defines where the numbering should start. Keep in mind support for this is subject to the e-reader.

&lt;ol start=”5”&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Nested lists
Lists can be nested inside other lists to establish a hierarchy by inserting another set of &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; tags.

Tables
Mozilla references: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td

Tables are a bit more difficult to define in XHTML, so I recommend arranging them neatly to avoid getting confused with each line representing a table row. There are 4 tags for defining tables:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt; are the parent tags for the whole table. All table content will go inside these.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; are the table row tags and define each row.
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; are the optional table heading tags.
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; are the table data tags which defines each cell.

For example, here is a table with the first column of reactive metals from the periodic table of elements with their name, symbol, mass number and atomic number:


Name
Symbol
Mass number
Atomic number
Hydrogen
H

1
Sodium
Na

3
Lithium
Li

11
Potassium
K

19
Rubidium
Rb

37
Caesium
Cs
132.91
55
Francium
Fr
223
87


This is the accompanying XHTML code to make this table:

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=”heading&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th class=”heading”&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mass number&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Atomic number&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hydrogen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Some tables have wider columns, this can be achieved with the column span (“colspan”) attribute.

Further reading

Several websites have exhaustive documentation of each HTML/XHTML tag, its attributes and compatibility across different web browsers. Visual Studio Code includes hyperlinks to Mozilla’s documentation and in the past I would refer to W3Schools for information of each tag.

            <Text>Introduction to Cascading StyleSheets (CSS)

Cascading StyleSheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to define the appearance of HTML (and by extension, XHTML) elements. CSS facilitates beautiful e-book typesetting and should be the forefront of an e-book’s design.
It is best to use external CSS where the classes are defined with one or several dedicated .css files. However, I will demonstrate the two other ways of adding CSS to an e-book project.

In-line CSS via the style attribute

Note: In-line CSS definitions are recommended solely for prototyping CSS classes and should not be used in production.

Each XHTML tag supports the “style” attribute, which facilitates in-line CSS definitions. This means CSS attributes can be applied to an individual tag without creating a CSS class. For example, adding bold and italic to span tag:

&lt;p&gt;The cat &lt;span style=”font-weight: bold; font-style: italic”&gt;sat&lt;/span&gt; on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;

The cat sat on the mat.

In a real e-book project, I would combine the bold &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and italic &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; tags instead of using a span to create bold italic for emphasis. 

Internal CSS via the head tag

Note: Internal CSS definitions are recommended solely for prototyping CSS classes and should not be used in production.

Internal CSS uses the style &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tag within the head tags to define one or more CSS classes for a specific XHTML file.

&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta content=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml; charset=utf-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;style&gt;
		span.bold-italic {
			font-weight: bold;
			font-style: italic;
		}
	&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The cat &lt;span class=”bold-italic”&gt;sat&lt;/span&gt; on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

External CSS via a dedicated .css file

\section*{Motivations for Piracy}

\subsection*{Convenience -- Piracy is a service problem}

oindent{Perceiving piracy as a competitive business is my preferred approach to reducing piracy. Understandably it is difficult to compete with a third-party offering a free product, though that doesn't mean that publishers can't consider their approach to content delivery to their paying customers.}\\


oindent{The best example of this that I know of is the popular digital video game marketplace Steam. Steam is a dominating force in digital distribution on the PC platform (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux). The PC platform is itself an open platform that anyone can create video games for without requiring approval from any single company...}\\


oindent{Gabe Newell is the founder and CEO of Valve Software who are notable as the developer and publisher of the acclaimed Half-Life and CounterStrike series. His view on piracy is notable when interviewed about Steam's success in the Russia, a country that is known for widespread piracy.}\\

“One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. It’s a service issue. The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It’s by giving those people a service that’s better than what they’re receiving from the pirates. For example, Russia. You say, oh, we’re going to enter Russia, people say, you’re doomed, they’ll pirate everything in Russia. Russia now outside of Germany is our largest continental European market.”
---Gabe Newell, founder and CEO of Valve Software (Geekwire, 2011)



oindent{In my experience I have had Amazon Prime Video reject me from playing back a movie because the HDMI cable I was using apparently didn't support the HDCP (High Definition Content Protection) standard.}

\subsection*{Price -- The product is too expensive}
%A US dollar has different value around the world - price purchasing parity

\subsection*{Availability -- The work is no longer officially available}


oindent{When a work is no longer officially supported by its publisher it becomes either out of print, or in the case of software -- abandonware.}


oindent{I am unhealthily obsessed with archival and am ready to admit I can understand why certain people can become compulsive hoarders. In this digital age information has never been more fragile and it is relatively easy for works to be lost forever when a single website goes down.}\\


oindent{Defective by Design is an initiative pushed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to oppose DRM. The reasoning is that software cannot be free for the end user to modify and distribute if there is a component that explicitly prevents that from taking place.}\\


oindent{Defective by Design offer an FAQ with a concerning situation where e-book copies of the famous book \textit{1984} by George Orwell were remotely removed by Amazon from Kindle e-readers without the consent of the account owner.}\\


oindent{\textit{``In 2009, Amazon remotely deleted copies of George Orwell's dystopian novel,} 1984\textit{, that were distributed through the Kindle store. This chilling example of potentially malicious behavior would have never been possible without DRM. DRM takes away your right to read.''} --- an answer to the question ``What are some examples of DRM?'' on the Defective by Design website FAQ\\


oindent{Microsoft removed their e-book store in 20??}\\


oindent{Video games are more difficult to preserve as they are interactive software requiring working native hardware and firmware, or instead sufficient emulation of aforementioned hardware and firmware to be usable.}


oindent{In 20??, Microsoft killed their service called Games for Windows Live rendering many games at least temporarily unplayable except to pirates who have cracked the DRM. Fortunately a significant portion of this library have been made available for purchase on Steam.}


oindent{Infact, listing video games that are officially unplayable due to DRM, loss of online functionality, or from being delisted on either one or several online stores could become its own book project because there are so many.}


oindent{For example, Nintendo have removed all online functionality from the Nintendo Wii including their entire digital library called WiiWare, classic games under the Virtual Console, all Nitnendo DS online functionality (except Pictochat which is peer-to-peer)DSi, 3DS.}\\

\section*{Anti-Piracy Law}


oindent{\textbf{Disclaimer:} I am not a lawyer, certainly not a copyright lawyer. Therefore this section will be particularly light. I do want to provide a summary of notable legislation and its impact worldwide.}

\subsubsection*{SOPA, PIPA and ACTA}

%Heavy-handed legal bills SOPA, ACTA, PIPA

oindent{Legal attempts to further prevent internet copyright infringement outside of the current DMCA have a reputation for being very heavy-handed. There has been a concerted effort back in 2011 for the United States government to propose bills that target websites that host content (such as images, videos and music), there were known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA).}
%Lamar Smith

oindent{\textit{“...It's the SOPA cabana, it's the SOPA, SOPA can ban ya...”}}
---Dan Bull\\

            <Title>Introduction to Typography</Title>
            <Text>Introduction to Typography

“Let’s kick off with the basics: what actually is typography? In essence, typography is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader. Typography involves font style, appearance, and structure, which aims to elicit certain emotions and convey specific messages. In short, typography is what brings the text to life.” 
—Career Foundry, What Is Typography, And Why Is It Important? [2022 Guide]

Let’s start with some definitions:

Typography refers to the study, use and creation of typefaces.
Fonts are a representation of a typeface for a specific use, such as on a computer.
Typefaces are lettering designs which can be upright or slanted, with different stroke thickness
Families are collections of weights and styles which a typeface has.
Glyphs are each individual character, number, letter or symbol within a typeface.
Weights refer to the difference in line thickness between one typeface and another in the same family. Many typeface families offer multiple weights intended for different uses.

//Diagram demonstrating different font weights (maybe use Roboto)

Typography relies on several imaginary lines to ensure each glyph is positioned appropriately.

#
The different typographical lines and how they relate to the position of the word “Sphinx”

Baseline is the line which all letters sit upon.
Ascender is the line above the cap height. For example, letters that have a tall stem such as “h”, “l” (lowercase “L”), “b” and “d”.
Descender is the line below the baseline. For example, letters such as “p” and “q” .
X-height is the height of the lowercase “x” and most other lowercase letters such as “a”, “c”, “e”, “m” and “n”.

Typography has been an important part of book design since its inception and remains significant when typesetting books and documents for either print or screen. 
In the case of e-books usually the default fonts are selected by the e-reader’s developer.
Typographical classifications:

Serif
Serif fonts have a stroke at the end of each letter and number, as well as other characters. 

2015 was a big year in the world of e-book typography because Google and Amazon commissioned bespoke fonts designed for long reading sessions on a screen.

Amazon has its own bespoke Bookerly font since 2015 primarily for its Kindle e-readers and reading apps.

Google has its own bespoke Literata font family…

Sans-serif
Monospaced (or fixed width)

#
Comparison of Times New Roman and Consolas. Each glyph in a monospaced font takes up the same amount of space.

Monospaced (also called fixed-width) fonts have each letter, number and symbol as the same width to assist with readability. They are usually used for technical purposes such as for programming or scriptwriting.
The two best known monospaced fonts are Courier and its successor Courier New.
Historically, Courier was designed by IBM for typewriters but was development into a computer font in the 1990s. Courier wasn’t trademarked, so there are many derivatives. 
Courier New was a redesign by legendary typographer Adrian Frutiger for Monotype with improved punctuation and to include support for more languages. It has been pre-installed as a system font since Microsoft Windows 3.1 and is a popular choice, particularly for older programmers.
Nowadays, there are many monospaced fonts to choose from that are either pre-installed on the operating system or can be downloaded for free. Since the mid-2000s it is common to include monospaced counterparts to proportional designs. Examples include Consolas, IBM Plex Mono, Ubuntu Mono, Fira Mono.

//Diagram comparing Consolas to Calibri, IBM Plex Sans Mono to IBM Plex Sans, Ubuntu to Ubuntu Mono, Fira Mono to Fira Sans, Roboto Mono to Roboto, Amazon Ember to Amazon Ember Mono.

JetBrains Mono is my current choice of monospaced font as it has clear lettering and is readable. When choosing a monospaced font for e-book development I would recommend checking the quote marks as they are often not clear at smaller sizes. //example

A comparison of Roboto Mono and JetBrains Mono.

Character encoding standards:
To make writing systems work on computers there are two main standards for character encoding, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and it’s successor Unicode.
ASCII was simplistic and only defined the uppercase and lowercase English alphabet, numbers, a select group of symbols and a set of invisible control characters.

#
These are all of the printable ASCII characters
//I’ll redo this diagram

Unicode is instead a more complete representation of the world’s writing systems and supports over 150 different languages both modern and ancient.
Each supported glyph within Unicode is part of a group of glyphs called a block. As it’s a superset of ASCII, the first block called Basic Latin contains all the ASCII characters. If you need a particular character it is likely already available in a Unicode block, though keep in mind very few fonts support Unicode completely.
It’s also worth knowing about Windows Glyph List (WGL) fonts

            <Text>Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a relatively new markup language designed as a simpler (and potentially more secure) alternative to HTML for creating documents. It was created by the late Aaron Schwartz and John Gruber in 2004.
Both GitHub and GitLab support Markdown extensively and it is recommended text-heavy content such as a repository’s wiki pages and for files such as the README.
There is no official Markdown file extension, though .md and .markdown are commonly accepted and supported. I prefer .md as it’s easier to type and takes up less characters.
This chapter is specifically about “GitHub-flavored Markdown” which is a derivative of CommonMark that was developed for use on GitHub.

Headings
Referring back to the XHTML tutorial, you may recall the different heading tags such as &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; and &lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;. Markdown uses a similar convention with the hash symbol (also confusingly called the “pound sign”). For example, I have created a main heading and subheading below:

# This is a heading

This is a heading

## This is a heading

This is a heading

Paragraphs
There is no symbol used for declaring paragraphs.

Unordered lists are defined with an asterisk before the

#
A reflowable e-book’s content should scale to the device it is being read on.

PDFs are not e-books

Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) has taken the world by storm and has become the standardised format for read-only documents under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 32000-2. The PDF is an open format that anyone can use then adapt freely and there is a seemingly endless choice of software for reading and editing them, including modern desktop web browsers.

PDFs are documents that are designed to preserve page sizing and layout making them appropriate for storing publications. Combine this with the ubiquitous reader options and you can see why they are mistaken for e-books.
Confusingly, Amazon Kindle and Google Play Books both allow the sale of PDF files in their e-book stores with little to differentiate them from reflowable e-books. PDFs provide from an inferior digital reading experience, particularly on small screens.
Another trend are companies who incentivise prospective customers with a free “e-book” to encourage them to sign up for a newsletter. Alan Dib explains in his book 1-Page Marketing Plan that physical books themselves are considered valuable and are unlikely to be thrown away, so this desire to use the word “e-book” could be a psychological effort for prospects to engage with content they would otherwise forget or outright ignore.

“Books, CDs and DVDs are other excellent items you can insert in envelopes to make them lumpy. Other than just attracting attention once off when being opened, these items generally don’t get thrown away. Your customers and prospects will likely keep what you sent them indefinitely and it will be a constant reminder of you.”
-Alan Dib, describing shock and awe marketing

Other typographical classifications:

Script

Display
Display fonts are decorative and designed for use at large sizes.

Blackletter
Blackletter fonts are calligraphic and originate from Western Europe in the 12th century.
They aren’t used very often because they aren’t easy to read.

Screen vs print fonts
https://blog.prototypr.io/what-to-watch-out-for-when-working-on-typography-for-print-and-web-3d754b87a3f4?gi=d4aef0c6fcef

Some fonts are designed specifically for screen use such as Georgia, or just work well on screen such as Times New Roman or Charter.

Bookscanning and OCR

In my last job my boss used an inverted “V” cradle made from glass and metal, then would take a photograph of each page using a DSLR camera. The photos would be imported into ABBYY FineReader for the text to be extracted using optical character recognition (OCR), before exporting to a Microsoft Word document. He considered this a significant improvement over the previous method of destructively removing each page individually from the binding and then scanning them with a flatbed scanner.
I am still developing my bookscanning process. I have been looking into free software alternatives to ABBYY FineReader such as Google’s Tesseract which is used in OpenOCR. I often make use of Google Photos’ own OCR engine and find it highly accurate. In the long-term I plan on purchasing and testing the CZUR book scanner.
https://www.diybookscanner.org/en/index.html has instructions on a homemade bookscanner. The website looks to have been neglected for a significant period of time and has missing images. Check https://archive.is/

Typesetting

Affinity Publisher (recommended)
Adobe InDesign

E-book distribution

You now have a finished ePub. But how do you sell it?

Amazon Kindle - Kindle Unlimited
Google Play Books
Apple Books
Kobo
itch.io

Digital Rights Management (DRM)

The ePub standard is intentionally neutral on the use of digital rights management (DRM) to control how customers interact with their e-book purchase. I am personally hostile to DRM because I find it inconvenient for the customer and most e-book DRM standards are bypassable anyway with freely-available public tools.
In my own research the DRM scheme I found the most difficult to bypass was VitalSource’s e-book file .vbk. Previously it was possible to see the XHTML source with the Chrome inspector, though that was patched recently after.

Adobe DRM (ADEPT)

Adobe DRM is used by Google Play Books and several other distributors, allowing offline reading on Adobe Digital Editions and Bluefire. It requires the user to activate Adobe Digital Editions with their Adobe ID (or create one), then authorise their computer. Once authorised download the .acsm file and then import it to download the actual ePub.

Adobe allow a total of 6 authorisations and it seems that resetting this amount requires contacting their customer support: https://community.adobe.com/t5/digital-editions-discussions/i-need-to-have-my-authorizations-reset-for-digital-editions-but-cannot-contact-anyone-at-adobe/td-p/5511638

From personal experience I have found Adobe DRM to be difficult to use requiring first contacting Google’s customer support and then on online forums for activation.
Keep in mind that when distributing using Adobe Digital Editions the XHTML and CSS code is accessible by extracting the ePub using an archiving program like 7-Zip.

Amazon DRM - AZW, KFX

Amazon use their own DRM for their Kindle e-books. The current standard is (KFX). Amazon provide reading apps on the web, smartphone/tablet and on Windows and macOS…

Copyright infringement of e-books (piracy)

“Piracy's a crime and crime doesn't pay
	And we go home poor at the end of the day
But I'd rather live my life in rags
	Than be chained to a desk with a wife that's a hag”
Drink, Alestorm

I plan on this to be either a subset of my piracy manifesto or just copied verbatim. I like the idea of using the Alestorm lyrics to introduce this chapter.

Currently, my TL;DR on e-book piracy is that most DRM for e-books is technically ineffective and can be inconvenient for users. If you want DRM that actually works I recommend distributing on Vitalsource’s Bookshelf store.
I think it’s better to reduce DRM and foster goodwill with users. Humble (formerly Humble Bundle) and O’Reilly have demonstrated that DRM-free is a viable option that doesn’t result in sudden bankruptcy.
Also much of the data on piracy is surprising including that pirates buy more content and is more nuanced than what large publishers, movie studios and record labels purport.

ONIX for Books

ONIX for Books is an XML-based standard for sharing book data between publishers, distributors and retailers using predefined fields and categories (defined as “code lists”).
I plan on creating my own libre ONIX editor and documentation for the perfect ONIX document. However, for the time being I recommend looking into ONIXEdit or creating your own ONIX record using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel.
https://www.editeur.org/14/Code-Lists/

Source code obfuscation
“In software development, obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans to understand.” 
-Obfuscation (software) article on Wikipedia

Source code obfuscation in software development makes it trickier to reverse-engineer a compile executable to find the original source code. Usually these are alterations made before or during compile time which don’t alter functionality.
While ebookbuild is libre software, I am interested in ways of achieving this for users who want an output that hides the exact XHTML and CSS code from a tinkering end-user.
After giving this process some thought I can only think of using Calibre ( ironically given ebookbuild’s goal to avoid autogenerated “meatground” code inside its ePub output). Calibre in my experience has a complex structure to its XHTML and CSS structure.

Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting is a method for identifying unique builds of an e-book. This could be used for review copies or ARC (advanced reader copies) to identify who leaked an e-book prior to release.
So far my only approach is to rely on checksums as they are unique to each build. Another way is to add comments referring to the reviewer in the XHTML or CSS code.</Text>

            <Text>Preface

Welcome to e-book development - much of this preface is expository, feel free to skip ahead.
Standing on the shoulders of giants
I want to impart over 2 years of knowledge and experience I learned about e-book development. As well as the improvements I have made since then.
My tenure at Oxford Ebooks Ltd.
My failed apprenticeship - I learnt a lot during my 1 year working at Oxford Ebooks…
What I learnt at marketing - we had a scattershot approach for picking up prospects - years later I would encounter The One Page Marketing Plan and realise how flawed this was.
Philosophical differences between myself and Andy Severn. What I recall from 6 years ago. The highly competitive video game industry has very little room for free software philosophy, except for a few exceptions such as Doom.
The job got me into digital book content
I still buy books published by Oxford eBooks and sci-fi-cafe.com.
I listen to audiobooks on Audible, infact I secured a free copy of The Seed Planet
I recommend A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess and The Art of the Argument by Stefan Molyneux, in particular. If you are particularly ready to have your perspective of heterosexual relations completely torn up I would also suggest The Rational Male book series by Rollo Tomassi.
Why use ebookbuild?
An open approach to e-book development using free software principles of open source code and abundant documentation. As well as cross-platform technologies with no vendor lock-in.
Entire control over the e-book’s presentation
No “meatgrinding” - The pitfalls of autogenerated code

            <Text>Recommended Software

E-book development is made possible using many different pieces of software. My goal is to develop e-books as quickly and affordably as possible with minimal subscriptions.
This is my preferred software though I also have some alternatives you can try:


Recommended
Alternative
Visual Studio Code
Atom, Notepad++
Windows Terminal

Text editor
A text editor is needed to create and then edit the XHTML, CSS and metadata.json files. Most of the time spent on an e-book will be using a text editor so it’s important that you can find it comfortable and easy to use.
Text editors may be the most common type of computer program with many options to choose from and I am aware of just how defensive some users can be of their preferred text editor (especially the vi vs. emacs editor wars).
Back at Oxford eBooks, we used Notepad++ for the bulk of our text editing. Notepad++ has an outdated user interface and is restricted to Microsoft Windows. For those reasons I consider Atom and Visual Studio Code to be suitable replacements. 
An appropriate text editor for e-book development should support the following features:

Syntax highlighting for XHTML, CSS, JSON and Markdown.
Find and replace with regular expressions

Visual Studio Code
# Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu
Visual Studio Code is my preferred text editor for several years.


Terminal emulator
Both macOS and GNU/Linux have an excellent preinstalled terminal which requires little modification except cosmetic changes such as the font size and background colour.
For Microsoft Windows I recommend installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which allows installation of a minimal GNU/Linux environment including the Bash shell.

Windows Terminal
# Microsoft Windows

Windows Terminal is the terminal emulator I’ve been waiting for and I was eagerly awaiting its stability when I first tested it in 2019. 
It is pre-installed on Windows 11. For Windows 10, it is recommended to install via the Microsoft Store, though it can be downloaded and installed manually or even compiled from source code in Visual Studio.


Git client
Git is a popular version control system (VCS) and I recommend using it for e-book development because it organises your workflow and backs up your work. In this book I have provided a dedicated Introduction to Git and GitHub chapter for information Git clients and how to get started with Git if you are complete newcomer.

GitHub Desktop
# Microsoft Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux

GitHub Desktop is GitHub’s own official client, primarily designed for GitHub accounts though ti works with third-party hosting sites such as GitLab. 
GitHub Desktop was designed as a graphical user interface (GUI) alternative to the standard Git command-line program. It’s very easy to use and contains most functionality that is needed for e-book development.
There are unofficial GNU/Linux builds for Debian, AppImage and Fedora/Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) courtesy of the developer Shiftkey. Despite GitHub publicly acknowledging and appreicating these builds, there are no plans at the time of writing for official GNU/Linux builds.

E-book reader (e-reader)
E-book readers (or e-readers) are software specifically designed to open and display e-book formats. There are many e-readers, though some are unreliable and do not render CSS correctly.

Web browser

A web browser is required to test the XHTML and CSS are working correctly, as well as testing the compiled ePub on Google Play Books web reader (https://play.google.com/books).

Brave
#
# Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Android, iOS

I use the Brave as my everyday web browser which includes e-book development. The debug tools allow simulation of different screen-sizes to test responsiveness.
Brave is a modification of the Chrome web browser with support for the majority of tested Chrome extensions. It also has the following notable features:

Brave Shields - contains advert and tracker blocking functionality built-in to the browser.
Brave Sync - replaces Google Sync and can be used to syncronise settings and preferences across multiple devices using a unique password or by scanning a quick response (QR) code.
Brave Rewards - Brave rewards its userbase for viewing advert notifications and sponsored “billboard” images on the new tab screen with the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT). The user can then donate BAT to websites or certain social media profiles based on the amount of time they spend on those pages.
Decentralised networking - Brave also has support for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and The Onion Router (TOR).

According to the BAT whitepaper, traditional internet advertising by design doesn’t respect user privacy and often irritates them with tracking adverts. Brave boasts that user data doesn’t leave the browser and users are rewarded for the time they take viewing adverts.

Chrome
# Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Android, iOS

Chrome is the dominant web browser and needs little introduction. It is Google’s own web browser.

Image editor and publishing software

British software house Serif develop affordable design software for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and the iPad that can be used as an alternative to the costly Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe CC). Each program is purchased once per 1.0 version and is currently priced at £47.99 GBP for each program in the UK.
For some use cases, the Adobe CC subscription may be a better deal as it includes other programs that Serif have not created alternatives for such as Adobe Lightroom and Adobe XD, as well as services such as Adobe Typekit and Adobe Stock.

Affinity Photo
# Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS (iPad)

Affinity Photo is a raster image editor comparable to Adobe Photoshop.

Affinity Designer
# Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS (iPad)

Affinity Designer is a vector image editor comparable to Adobe Illustrator.

Affinity Publisher

SOMA.fm (https://somafm.com) is an independent advert-free radio station run by Rusty Hodge boasting 30 different playlists. Back at Oxford eBooks, the go-to station for background music while developing e-books was Groove Salad which plays ambient music.

There is also an unofficial Groove Salad Spotify playlist called Groove Salad Complete by beautifully chilled which contains an assortment of tracks that are typically played on Groove Salad.

Miscellaneous:

The video game Grand Theft Auto: IV (GTA IV) has an in-game radio station called The Journey which has several ambient tracks.

Global Communication - 5:23 (Maiden Voyage) (1994)
Terry Riley - A Rainbow In Curved Air (1969)
Steve Roach - Arrival (1986)

Phillip Glass - Pruit Igoe (1983)
Tangerine Dream - Remote Viewing (1981)
Aphex Twin - Z Twig (1994)
Ray Lynch - The Oh Of Pleasure (1984)

Odysseus is a YouTuber who creates synthwave and chillwave playlists. Chillwave music can be good background music. I recommend the following playlists:

Night Drive - A Chillwave Mix
Waves - A Chillwave Mix
Tokyo Drive - A Chillwave Mix

            <Text>Preface

“If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.”
—Isaac Newton, in a 1675 letter to Robert Hooke

I have written this preface to explain the my justification for the ebookbuild project and my motivations for creating it. If this isn’t interesting to you, feel free to skip ahead.

Welcome to e-book development

By reading this book you are at least curious about the process of e-book development and the best way to have complete control over your next project.

Why ebookbuild?

Origins

The ebookbuild project exists, because I am unsatisfied with using the current e-book development software out there and want full control over my projects.
I started my first job back in September 2014 at the age of 21, working for Oxford eBooks Ltd.
Oxford eBooks a very small publishing house that provided e-book development services for a variety of clientele ranging from both small and medium publishers, as well as independent authors.
E-books created there were made from scratch using XHTML and CSS in a text editor, quickly tested using a web browser to ensure the chapters are at least visible and then compiled using proprietary tools to generate a ePub file. 
The ePub would be run through epubcheck, the official tool created by the owner of the ePub standard to ensure it had “No errors or warnings detected.” An e-book that repeatedly failed epubcheck would need to be continuously worked on until it was ready for final testing.
Testing was performed in e-reader to ensure it at least matched, or even improved the supplied manuscript. Any alterations would be recorded in a conversion log which allowed for easy scrutiny and reversion (to revert).
This meticulous approach to e-book development is the foundation and chief inspiration for the ebookbuild project.

Improvements

At the time I created Project Zylon as a means to continue e-book development after I left Oxford eBooks Ltd. a year later. After consideration I wanted to formerly name the project as something relevant, easy to remember and that would resemble a terminal command so I chose ebookbuild. This is why I stylistically choose to write ebookbuild in a monospaced font.
I had formally been introduced to both the concept and development process of an e-book, but wanted to do more with the technology as much of the e-book projects I worked on were novels, religious books and the occasional non-fiction biography. I wanted new projects such as cookbooks, technology books and antiquarian remasters.
Another desire, was to release the source code publicly under a licence approved by either the Open Source Initiative (OSI) or the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to facilitate further improvements and usage. I have admired the concept of free software since I first learnt about it in 2012 and my affection for it went up when I released my Pokétch Digital watchface for the Pebble smartwatch under the permissive MIT licence. The project has 10 stars on GitHub and been forked several times which is impressive considering I am by no means a C programmer.

//Picture of the Pokétch Digital watchface

The old tools that used and I can barely speak of in fear of reprisal weren’t ideal and violated core principles. I had become accustomed to these principles when reading about the history and philosophy of free software (as defined by Richard Stallman and the GNU project), so I wanted something I had complete control over that could grow into a useful set of tools for anyone with an interest in creating e-books from scratch.
To familarise myself with e-book development I was fortunate to stumble upon Eric Muss-Barnes’ tutorial for creating ePub files. 
I created ebookbuild so it had no proprietary dependencies and could be used cross-platform. Then made it available under GNU General Public License 3 (GPLv3) to encourage, but also enforce sharing the tool to make it available to as many interested people as possible.

#
Much of the ebookbuild project is licenced under GNU GPLv3.

One of the prerequisites for free software is thorough documentation, preferably easy to understand. So I have created an e-book that references as much as I have learnt in my one year in commercial e-book development, as well as what I have found out on my own since then. I want to make it accessible as possible so I have released it under a Creative Commons licence to encourage mass-sharing. The source code is on GitHub and I encourage raising issues and pull requests.
Lastly, I released technical files that are required for e-book production such as XHTML, CSS and JSON files under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licence, effectively putting them into the public domain. I don’t think the code used for these files isn’t particularly special or unique, so they can be re-purposed outside of ebookbuild uncredited, though credit is always appreciated.

1. Note: My former boss was stringent about trade secrecy and non disclosure agreements (NDA),  owing to his background in video game development. I have described the process I was taught using a combination of information from the business terms page on the company website, as well as other public sources.

2. The GNU project defines free software as: “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.
You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.

3. It’s worth juxtaposing copyleft with copyfree.
	Copyleft licencing such as GPLv3 ensures all publicly released copies of a program must have their source code available with the permission to make alterations and compile them into a new program.
	Copyfree licencing such as MIT ensures the developer who first modifies the source code has control over the availability of the source code, alterations made to it and distribution of the new program.

Before Git

Back at Oxford eBooks we simply mounted shared folders from a company network-attached storage (NAS) server onto our work computers using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. We then altered the contents of the e-book project directly using File Explorer.

//A demonstrated screenshot of SMB

I assume this NAS server was configured with multiple hard drives in a redundant arrangement of independent disks (RAID) configuration. It would then have regular backups to reduce data loss. In simple terms, RAID combines hard drives together to make them work more efficiently. The company had a strict on-premises data policy and use of the cloud was avoided due to concern of a possible data breach.
While a NAS solution is acceptable for an individual or small team developing e-books, I prefer using a version control system such as Git which is connected to a cloud hosting service such as GitHub or GitLab for the following reasons:

Allows developers to log alterations made with commit logs and clearly shows differences between each commit.
Commits can be reverted easily without guesswork as to what was changed previously
Easily syncronises the data between multiple servers and user computers
Designed specifically for collaboration
Cross-platform (i.e. works on Microsoft Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux)
Several Git clients such as GitHub Desktop and GitKraken are easy to use.
It’s fast to use
E-book projects don’t tend to have very large files, which is a notable shortcoming of Git

What is Git?

#
The Git logo

Git is a version control system and a popular way of managing software development by ensuring code is backed up and easily retrievable. 
The Git project itself was designed by none other than Linus Torvalds himself who needed a way to manage the development of the Linux kernel because the current BitKeeper version control system used at the time had stopped offering free repository hosting for free software developers.
The story behind BitKeeper pulling their free hosting service is an interesting into the ethics of free software and vendor lock-in. Fellow developer Andrew Tridgell reverse-engineered the BitKeeper proprietary protocol to facilitate the creation of an alternative to BitKeeper’s proprietary client software which was required to interact with files in the repository on the local computer. BitKeeper’s management was unhappy their protocol had been reverse-engineered and pulled their free hosting service. Tridgell would later reverse engineer the aforementioned SMB protocol and call it Samba, a project that lives on today!
As for BitKeeper it is still available and ironically released under the Apache License in 2016. Development has reportedly stopped in 2018 and the project is now abandoned.

#
Linus Torvalds invented the Linux kernel, Git and a diving app called Subsurface

Git’s unusual name was explained by Linus Torvalds in the project’s README file:

GIT - the stupid content tracker

&quot;git&quot; can mean anything, depending on your mood.

- random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a mispronounciation of &quot;get&quot; may or may not be relevant.
- stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
- &quot;global information tracker&quot;: you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
- &quot;goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t&quot;: when it breaks

This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory contents efficiently. 

Git can be used in the cloud via a dedicated hosting service such as GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket which I recommend for convenience. Alternatively, Git servers can be created on-premises via software such as Bonobo, Gogs or even GitLab.
Use of Git is mandatory for anyone using GitHub and GitLab, as well as being supported by other source code hosting sites such as BitBucket. 
I recommend Git for e-book development because it is fast and e-book projects don’t tend to have large files (more than 50MB) or empty folders, which are some of Git's notable shortcomings.
This chapter will give a basic outline of how Git works and how to use it. However, Git is very popular and there’s plenty of documentation available for it, including an official book (which is available for free on the official Git website) – I won't make this guide completely definitive.


Using Git at first may seem intimidating as there are a lot of jargon words to learn. However, I will explain each core feature and by the end, you should be able to start setting up your first repository with some confidence.


Git clients


To get started, I recommend using a Git client. There are a lot of Git clients, and official Git website keeps a list of them.

My personal choice of client is GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop is free and open-source with ports for Windows and macOS (and also albeit unofficially Debian, Fedora and AppImage).
As its name heavily implies the client is owned by GitHub (now Microsoft) and connects with GitHub seamlessly, however it also supports connecting to other Git hosting services such as GitLab and Bitbucket along with self-hosted Git servers.

GitKraken is also a superb client with a beautiful user interface and has official builds for Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 
However, for commercial use you must pay an annual subscription of GBP£ 4.95 (USD$ 4.95) a month . This includes access to private repositories on GitHub and other Git hosting services. GitKraken’s justification for the cost is that GitHub Desktop is a simplified Git command line replacement whereas GitKraken is an outright replacement for both with a number of features.


The basics of Git

I find the easiest metaphor to describe Git is to think of a filing cabinet:

The repository is the cabinet itself and a branch is each drawer. 
You pull out a filing cabinet draw to access its contents
Make your changes to the drawer
Note down the changes that were made and you push the drawer closed when you are finished. 
A pull request in this analogy would be when one office worker requests access to another filing cabinet to alter a few files inside and needs the key.

Here is a glossary of common terms used by Git with its corresponding icon on GitHub Desktop:

# Repository – A repository is the of Git that holds a project and covers an entire folder and its contents including files and subfolders. This is where a project will be placed and all the source code files and resources that make it.

# Branch – A branch is the part of the repository where commits are added. By default, a Git repository uses the master (or main) branch and for basic Git use by an individual developer, this shouldn’t be a concern.
For more complicated development, separate branches are used for development and testing. A branch can be merged bringing those changes to another branch or the branch can be split off. The way Git handles branching is the reason Git is referred to as a distributed source code management system.

# Commit – A commit is an alteration made to the repository that has been accepted by the developer. This includes any changes made to the files and folders including editing the text files, adding files, deleting files, moving files, etc.
Most Git clients will show the differences between the files using colour-coding. A commit requires a short title for the Git commit log and an optional description which can be handy for keeping track of development and writing notes.

# Publish – A publish is when the repository is being pushed from a Git client for the first time.

# Push – A push is the process of sending the commit from the development machine to the Git server.

# Pull – A pull is the process of retrieving previously pushed data to the Git server back onto the development machine. Through a combination of pushing and pulling a developer can work on the same code on multiple machines.

# Issue – An issue is a request raised by another user on a Git hosting website such as GitHub or GitLab. An issue could be for an additional feature or to report a bug.

# Pull Request – A pull request is specific to Git hosting websites where a user requests permission for their commit to be pulled into the repository they don't have direct access to.

# Fork – A fork is a copy of the repository made from the latest commit to another user. Usually forks are made to preserve a repository or to make alterations to the original in the form of a pull request.

Clone a repository from GitHub using GitHub Desktop

As mentioned earlier, setting up GitHub Desktop with GitHub is a snap. 
// First and foremost, you need to decide if the repository is already on GitHub or you want to add a repository to GitHub Desktop…


If the repository is already on GitHub, you can make a local copy of that repository on your development machine’s hard drive:

1. Go to File → Clone repository… (Ctrl-Shift-O).
2. Select the “GitHub.com” tab (the default) and click the “Sign in” button.
3. Sign in to GitHub using your account.
4. Choose a repository to clone and the preferred folder for the repository on your development machine’s storage (by default, it’s placed in Documents/GitHub).

After that you can open the repository’s folder in your file manager (such as File Explorer or Finder) or preferred text editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Atom).


Clone a repository from GitLab using GitHub Desktop

If the repository is already on GitLab it requires more involvement to make a copy on the development machine’s hard drive:

Login to GitLab.com in your preferred web browser, then select your preferred repository and copy the HTTPS link under the repository's name and description.

Create a SSH key to authenticate GitLab with GitHub desktop. This is done by opening up the Git Bash (Windows/macOS/GNU-Linux) or Terminal (macOS/GNU-Linux) then running this command (replace the e-mail in double-quotes with the GitLab account e-mail address): ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your.email@example.com&quot; -b 4096 then save the public-private key as a .pub file.

Authenticate the generated key by going to GitLab.com in your preferred browser and to your account’s settings and select “SSH Keys”. Add a new key by copying and pasting the public key half from the generated .pub file which begins with “ssh-rsa” into the text field then give it a name.

Go to File → Clone repository… (Ctrl-Shift-O).

Select the “URL” tab and paste the HTTPS link from earlier. Login to GitLab and then choose which repository to clone and where on the development machine’s hard drive to clone it to (the default is Documents/GitHub, but I rename it to Documents/GitLab).

I also recommend creating an access token on GitLab which you can use for GitHub Desktop and other third-party apps that need access to your GitLab account.

Go to your profile name and icon → Preferences
Access Token…

Committing and pushing to a repository in GitHub Desktop

Once changes have been made to the development machine’s copy of the repository, they can be committed to the repository on the Git server. GitHub Desktop makes committing a repository easy to do.

1. Select the files to commit and the branch to commit to (leave it as the Master branch if unsure).
2. Write a summary for the changes and if necessary a longer description.
3. Select “Submit” and then “Push origin”.
4. Select the “History” tab to ensure it has been committed properly.

            <Text>HTML entity tables

As mentioned in the Introduction to XHTML chapter, entities allow the insertion of Unicode characters into both XHTML and regular HTML. Entities are declared using the ampersand (&amp;) character, its name or numeric value and then closed with a semi colon (;),
For convenience, I have provided tables which can be referred to when you need to insert a character into your e-book project. Keep in mind that some glyphs may not render if the font doesn’t support the required character set.
As mentioned previously I try to avoid using too many entities as it can make the XHTML pages less human-readable.

Reserved entities

The following characters must be used as entities because they form the HTML syntax and would otherwise result in an invalid page.

Diacritic entities

Diacritics are accents that are applied letters to indicate pronunciation or vocal emphasis. Strangely, English doesn’t use diacritics except for loan words though most languages use them in some form.
Depending on your keyboard layout, some characters are easy to insert and would easier to

The ebookbuild project makes use of several free, libre and open-source software (FLOSS) licences. This chapter provides an easy explanation for each one and what their purpose is for, though keep in mind that it is recommended to read the licence thoroughly.

Copyleft
Copyleft licensing requires publicly-released derivatives of a project to have all the available source code and documentation to facilitate further modifications.
Richard Stallman first outlined copyleft intentions in the famous GNU Manifesto which was released in 1985.

“GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary modifications will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free.”
