	<p class="noindent top">I remember when I first interacted with an e-book and that was in the summer of 2013. I was on a flight with my family either going to or heading back from New York (JFK) and as a way of keeping myself preoccupied I asked if I could use my sister's Amazon Kindle e-ink e-reader. I was intrigued at the time because I liked how unlike PDF files the reader could interact with the text, they could make it larger or change the font to give themselves a more comfortable reading experience.</p>
	<p>In the late summer of 2014 I managed to get myself an apprenticeship in e-book development near Oxford. I was fortunate because I had dropped out of university after admittedly an emotionally turbulent year. There I was taught much that I know today about developing e-books with the vendor-locked, proprietary, in-house software.<a id="cit-1" href="introduction.xhtml#ref-1"><sup>i</sup></a> The apprenticeship ended a year later but when I left I felt unsatisified, I liked developing e-books and I wanted to find a way to make to process of developing them from scratch available to everyone and that was my motivation for what would later become <span class="mono">ebookbuild</span>.</p>
	<p>Along with making a freely-available cross-platform e-book creation tool, I wanted to assist prospective users as much as possible by providing several sample projects analyse and making the source code (though <b>not</b> the content) of the e-book available under a public domain license.<a id="cit-2" href="introduction.xhtml#ref-2"><sup>ii</sup></a></p>
	<p>This book is also one of my sample projects. I liken it to the RPG Maker VX tutorial game <i>RPG Maker VX School</i> as you can learn not just by running the game but also by examining the source code that made it.<a id="cit-3" href="introduction.xhtml#ref-3"><sup>iii</sup></a></p>

	<p class="ref"><a id="ref-1" href="introduction.xhtml#cit-1">i.</a> The official marketing term for the software is "bespoke toolchain", unlike <span class="mono">ebookbuild</span> it had no name.</p>
