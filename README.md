# ebookbuild

A very WIP cross-platform FOSS tool to create e-books properly. Currently makes both reflowable and fixed-layout ePub 2.0.1 e-books.

Currently the code is found in individual repositories rather than centralised here in this repository. The latest e-book is *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, the version of ebookbuild's main script `CreateE-book.py` is 0.8 (needs to support nested pages, compression and the ePub 3.0+ standard for 1.0).

ebookbuild in Python, although there are considerations to possibly switch language for speed improvements. I may use tkinter to develop a GUI.
