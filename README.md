# ebookbuild

A very WIP cross-platform FOSS tool to create e-books properly (meaning that ePubs and possibly Mobis generated with ebookbuild comply fully with their respective standards).

Currently the code doesn't work, added to GitHub to centralise development.

Programmed in Python + tkinter for GUI, although there are considerations to possibly switch language for speed improvements.
