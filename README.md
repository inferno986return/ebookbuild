# ebookbuild

A very WIP cross-platform FOSS tool to create e-books properly, built entirely with FOSS technologies (so no vendor lock-in). Currently ebookbuild makes both reflowable and fixed-layout ePub 2.0.1 e-books.

Currently the code is found in individual repositories rather than centralised here in this repository. The latest e-book is *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, the version of ebookbuild's main script `CreateE-book.py` is 0.8 (needs to support nested pages, compression and the ePub 3.0+ standard for 1.0).

ebookbuild is programmed in Python 3, although there are considerations to possibly switch language for speed improvements. I may use tkinter to develop a GUI.

## Features

### Current features (v0.8)
* Supports ePub 2.0.1.
* Supports reflowable and fixed-layout e-books.
* Supports anchor tags in the `toc.ncx`.
* Books generated convert nicely to .Mobi in Kindle Previewer.

### Planned features
* Get the script to run in IDLE and Thonny again (a strange bug means it won't run in those IDEs, yet runs in GNU Bash perfectly).
* Support ePub 3.1 and any future ePub releases.
* Support nested pages in the `toc.ncx`.
* Support compression (particularly desirable for image-heavy e-books)
* Support the ONIX 3 standard fully within the `metadata.json`.

## Examples
ebookbuild has been used to make the following e-books. Projects can be commercial or freely available to download.
